    <h1>VishwaCTF 2023</h1>
    <p>
        Last month, I had the opportunity to participate in my first team CTF (Capture The Flag), named VishwaCTF,
        conducted by CyberCell VIIT.<br>
        Our expectations were low since my team (Safiya Amin, Jahan Chaware, Rhutuj Bhoir) and I had no experience in
        this type of event.<br>
        However, I was pleasantly surprised when we were in the top 10% of nearly 2000 participants.<br>
        The competition was challenging and required us to think creatively. The challenges were unique and gave a sense
        of rush after solving them.<br>
        I found two OSINT flags and one flag each from the Forensics and Web categories.<br>
        To obtain these flags, I had to find hidden clues in the challenge descriptions, solve crazy riddles, reverse
        voice files, de-encrypt images, and search for old bollywood movies like Zameen.<br>
        Sometimes, all it needed was a Google search and some common sense!<br>
        There are many amazing challenges I couldn't crack, where I had to spend hours piecing together parts of a QR
        code scattered in a video!<br>
        You can view the challenges and their write-ups <a

            rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" style="color: white;">here</a>.<br>
        Overall, I gained valuable skills and knowledge from this CTF. I recommend anyone interested in cybersecurity or
        looking to challenge themselves to participate in CTFs.<br>
        You can find active CTFs from sites like <a href="https://ctftime.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" style="color: white;">ctftime</a>. You can practice from many sites like
        picoctf, hackthebox, hackthissite, etc.<br>
