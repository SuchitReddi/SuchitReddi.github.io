TIER1 Security Event Monitoring Analyst
Intro-
One such recent project is setting up SIEM for my network using a Raspberry Pi. I spend my free time reading either about latest tech advancements or interesting stories from the past. 
I participate in competitions and listen to technology podcasts to keep myself updated. I like to automate small tasks I repeat daily. I set up webpages to simplify tasks, like remote decryption of my raspberry pi. 
I write about my findings and experiences on platforms like LinkedIn and my website.


Alternate Elevator Speech-
My name is Suchit. I am a final year student with a major in Electronics and minor in Computers, graduating from Shiv Nadar University, Delhi on May 26th. I am from Visakhapatnam. 
I am passionate about cybersecurity, and have worked on various personal and academic projects on the same. I completed my IBM Cybersecurity Analyst certification. 
I worked as an Automation Intern at Irdeto, a cybersecurity company, for 3 months. There, I learned about security in set-top-boxes (Conditional access CA and Digital Rights Management DRM). 
I did many projects but never had the opportunity to work in a company that contributes to the society. After reading the job description of this role, it seemed like a good fit. And that's what brings me here for this exciting opportunity.

Passion story-
When I was in my intermediate, I wanted to gain access to Wi-Fi to download some large games. So, I looked into Wi-Fi hacking, and was successfully able to get into one of my neighbour's Wi-Fi network. 
Ofcourse I told the neighbours about this later. But this made me realise how easy it was to gain access to someone's network. So, I started to look for ways to defend myself against such attacks.
Around the same time, my college provided us with tablets. I was the one who cracked the software they used to lock it so that me and my friends can play games on it.

Strengths and Weaknesses -
I always meet deadlines, but I start working on it as the deadline approaches. But I started doing that work as soon as it is given, in small chunks to manage time better.
I like documenting what I do.

Related personal projects -
Setting up a honeypot using open canary to monitor my Raspberry Pi for unauthorized access attempts or non-malicious connection attempts.
Trying to setup a security monitoring system on the raspberry pi using ELK siem.
