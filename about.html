      Hi! I am Suchit. I am an Undergraduate student at Shiv Nadar Institute of Eminence. This website is a portfolio of
      some of my personal work, mostly on Cyber Security.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in Cyber Security started when I was 15. I started learning the basics of Networks to hack my
      neighbour's Wi-Fi. I started learning more from various YouTube channels and articles. I was also very much
      interested in Detective Mysteries. This made me want to become something close to a Digital Forensic Investigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on Python Automation, Keyloggers, Web Vulnerabilities, and Voice Spoofing Detection. I gained
      considerable
      skills in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Networks, Web and API Vulnerabilities this way. I also got to work
      with various Operating Systems like Kali Linux, Windows, Virtual Machines and Docker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to keep myself updated with the latest Cyber Security topics by listening to Podcasts like DarkNet Diaries,
      Malicious Life, and by creating custom RSS feeds. I recently started participating in Capture the Flag (CTF)
      competitions to improve my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning new things. I am currently learning SEIM tools, and Digital Forensics. I love watching thrillers
      and mysteries. I sometimes learn random things like Touch Typing, and Morse code. I can fluently speak in English
      and Telugu, and I am learning Hindi and French.
    </p>
