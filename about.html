        Hi! I am Suchit. I am an Undergraduate student at Shiv Nadar Institute of Eminence. This website is about
        my work, mostly on Cyber Security.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in Cyber Security started when I was 15. I started learning the basics of Networks to hack my
        neighbour's Wi-Fi. I started learning more from various YouTube channels and articles. I was also very much
        interested in Detective Mysteries. This made me want to become something close to a Digital Forensic
        Investigator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am developing 
        I worked on Python Automation, Keyloggers, Web Vulnerabilities, and Voice Spoofing Detection. I gained
        considerable skills in Storage Forensics, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Networks, Web and IoT Security.
        I also worked on various operating systems like Kali Linux, Raspberry Pi OS, Windows, Virtual Machines, and Docker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently working on: "<a href="https://github.com/SuchitReddi/cybersentinel" target="_blank">Cybersentinel</a>", "<a href="https://github.com/SuchitReddi/memorywipe" target="_blank">Memory Wipe</a>"
      </p>
      <p>
        I love watching thrillers and mysteries. I like to learn new things.
        I sometimes learn random things like Touch Typing, and Morse code. I can fluently speak in
        English and Telugu. I am currently learning Hindi and French.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts of consiousness and subconsiousness of the brain, and the human thought process in general started
        fascinating me recently. Maybe the time when humans create implantable memory chips is not very far!
