        Hi! I am Suchit. I am an Undergraduate student at Shiv Nadar Institute of Eminence. This website is a portfolio
        of my personal work, mostly on Cyber Security.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in Cyber Security started when I was 15. I started learning the basics of Networks to hack my
        neighbour's Wi-Fi. I started learning more from various YouTube channels and articles. I was also very much
        interested in Detective Mysteries. This made me want to become something close to a Digital Forensic
        Investigator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on Python Automation, Keyloggers, Web Vulnerabilities, and Voice Spoofing Detection. I gained
        considerable skills in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Networks, Web and API Vulnerabilities this way.
        I also got to work with various Operating Systems like Kali Linux, Windows, Virtual Machines and Docker.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on a project to solve the issue of Personal data retrieval even after erasing data from
        IoT devices using NAND flash memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning new things. I am currently learning Digital Forensics and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). I
        love watching thrillers
        and mysteries. I sometimes learn random things like Touch Typing, and Morse code. I can fluently speak in
        English and Telugu, and I am learning Hindi and French.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts of consiousness and subconsiousness of the brain, and the human thought process in general started
        fascinating me recently. Let's see where it goes from here.
