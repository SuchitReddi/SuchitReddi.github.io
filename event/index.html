    <h2>Rant about events or threats I came across</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sextortion Scam: </b>Phishing campaign<br>
            <br>
            I received two mails on Aug 6&7, 2024. Both were from fake mails hartleysivertsengivoraki[@]gmail[.]com, taishathomlisonculucaci[@]gmail[.]com.<br>
            There was a pdf attached, which has a generic threat saying that the attacker installed a malware when you visited a porn site, and recorded you through your webcam.<br>
            The attacker demands a ransom in bitcoin to not release the video to your contacts.<br>
            <br>
            The attacker knows my phone number and a user name I gave to some site I don't remember. So, I assume the attacker got my info from a data breach.<br>
            After IP and header analysis, I concluded that the malicious actor is using a compromised email server related to Google.<br>
            The following IPs were used: 209[.]85[.]220[.]41, 209[.]85[.]220[.]65.<br><br>
