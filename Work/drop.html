        <h1>Smart Drop - Irrigation System using STM32 [Apr 2023 (1 month)]</h1>
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
            I contributed a little bit for this project. At first, we thought of using a Wi-Fi module to send the data
            collected by sensors to a local server, from where it can be controlled.<br>
            I took upon myself to look into the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. But understanding the inbuilt HAL functions of
            STM32 in such short time period was difficult. So, we had to leave it as a future functionality to make this
            project an IoT project.<br>
            We used an STM32F303RE microcontroller, a soil moisture and rain sensor, a relay, a motor pump, and a buzzer
            in the place of LED for indicating the user.<br>
            This smart device is capable of detecting whether the soil is wet or dry using the soil moisture sensor. It
            senses rain intensity using the rain sensor.<br>
            The water supply is turned on only when the soil is dry and rain intensity is low. In all the other three
            cases, the water supply will be shut off.<br>
