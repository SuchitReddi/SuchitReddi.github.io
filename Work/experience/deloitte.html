        <h1>Deloitte - SOC Analyst - 10 Months (15/07/24 - Present)</h1>
        <p>
            I started working in Deloitte right after my graduation on May 26th 2024 (PS: Archived interview details in del*_int*.txt). After a month and half of training, I started on operations.<br>
            There are two main categories of daily work. Triaging mails reported by users and handling incident tickets. The job is to analyse and detect any malicious IOCs affecting the firm.<br>
            If malicious, remediation is done. In many cases the ticket will be escalated to Tier 2 for further investigation. The main purpose of Tier 1 is to filter the tickets to escalate.<br><br>

            Within the first 6 months, I saw an opportunity to automate the process of investigating the maliciousness of IOCs in OSINT sites. So, I wrote a script for myself.<br>
            It was written in Batch and it takes IOCs and opens the results in a browser along with printing the urls out on the terminal. But I needed permission to run scripts on my device.<br>
            So, when I asked my manager for permission, he said this script will be useful for the whole team and to make it more user friendly.<br>
            Over the next few months, I worked on improving the script. I converted it to powershell. The script saved a lot of time and provided wider perspective to the analysts.<br>
            
            My work on the OIS (OpenSource IOC Scanner) earned me the prestigious "Innovator Award FY25" during an All-hands meet event on May 26th 2025, exactly an year after my graduation.<br>
