    <h1>Automation</h1>
    <h2>Internship and Personal Project</h2>
    <p>
        Automation makes your life easy! I always wanted to learn it so that I can automate the boring tasks.<br>
        Python is a good language to start learning automation, but you don't need to be a programmer to automate tasks.<br>
        I used to make automated flows on an android application called "Automate", to do some cool tasks like turning off Wi-Fi when I leave home, etc.<br>
        I started writing batch files which use windows commands to automate small tasks like flushing dns cache, opening specific repos in git bash, etc in a single click.<br>
        I also wrote a batch file to check the hash of a file at a specific location.<br>
        My internship at Irdeto was also on automation. I had to create scripts to automate test cases for a STB box, using an application called Witbe.<br>
        Writing automation scripts will need critical and creative thinking. Sometimes you'll face problems which no-one ever faced before, where you'll have to think out of the box.<br>
