    <h1>Automation</h1>
    <h2>Internship and Personal Project</h2>
    <p>
      Automation makes your life easy! I always wanted to learn it so that I can automate the boring tasks.<br>
      Python is a good language to start learning automation, but you don't need to be a programmer to automate
      tasks.<br>
      I used to make automated flows on an android application called "Automate", to do some cool tasks like turning off
      Wi-Fi automatically when I leave home, etc.<br>
      I started writing <a href="./scripts.html">scripts</a> which use windows commands to automate small tasks like
      flushing dns cache, opening specific repos in git bash, checking hash value for files, etc.<br>
      My internship at Irdeto was also on automation. I had to create scripts to automate test cases for a STB box,
      using an application called Witbe.<br>
      Writing automation scripts will need critical and creative thinking. Sometimes you'll face problems which no-one
      ever faced before, where you'll have to think out of the box.<br>
      There are various ways to automate things in linux by using crontab, editing the .bashrc/.zshrc file etc.<br>
      I am currently working on an automated script to securely erase, and extract binary dumps for different types of
      storage devices.<br>
