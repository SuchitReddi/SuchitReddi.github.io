      <b>Working of SSD</b><br>
      Flash memory used in SSDs is cheap with high read/write speeds. This makes it ideal for usage in IoT devices.<br>
      However it's working is different from the old magnetic disks used in HDDs. If you edit a file on a HDD,
      it is actually deleted and overwritten.<br>
      But in SSDs, the data can be deleted only in blocks but not as individual cells. If you edit a few bits in an
      SSD, you have to delete the entire block just to edit those few bits.<br>
      This results in a lot of program and erase (PE) cycles. SSDs have limited PE cycles. So, overwriting is done
      differently.<br>
      When a file is edited, the controller marks the old block as invalid and writes the new data to a different
      location.<br>
      When the system asks for the updated file, it gives the new location. But the old data is still present in the old
      location.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Forensic Issues</b><br>
      When you delete a file, the controller marks the file pointer as invalid without actually deleting it.<br>
      The actual deletion happens when the SSD is idle, in the background. Processes like garbage collection, TRIM, and
      wear leveling are involved.<br>
      Once a block is marked invalid, it is inaccessible to the operating system. You have to hack the flash controller
      to access it. There are methods requiring sophisticated hardware and expertise to access unmanaged blocks. <br>
      Unlike HDDs, write blockers have no impact on stopping wear levelling.<br>
      So theoretically if you leave your device idle for a long time, the SSD itself should delete your data.
      But there is no fixed time after which the file is actually erased.<br>

      <b>Flash memory problems</b><br>
      On HDDs, writing random or (0/1)s to the entire disk is enough to make the data unrecoverable. Degaussing and
      physical destruction are used to make the drive unusable.<br>
      So, it is fairly easy to securely sanitize HDDs. But in SSDs, it is very hard but possible to access these
      unmanaged/invalid blocks.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Sanitization Methods</b><br>
      These methods should work on flash storages, but most importantly on IoT devices.<br>
      <b>ATA Secure Erase</b><br>
      This is set of commands will activate manufacturer provided firmware functions to erase the drive.<br>
      It is the most secure method to sanitize SSDs. But it is not supported by all manufacturers. And it was also
      found by some researchers that many manufacturers does not implement sanitization correctly.<br>

      <b>Cryptographic Wiping</b><br>
      The entire drive is encrypted using VeraCrypt. It was chosen because of its wide compatibility range,
      including ARM devices (Raspberry Pi).<br>
      The encrypted drive, along with the key is overwritten with a pass of random values and zeroes. The drive is
      then formatted into a usable filesystem format.<br>

      <b>Automatic Wiping</b><br>
      This option checks compatibility of the device with different sanitization methods in the tool and apply the most
      compatible one.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Verification</b><br>
      To verify if data is still accessible, I used an open source forensics tool called "Autopsy".<br>
      There are better tools like Cellebrite, and Magnet Axiom, but they are neither open source, nor cheap.<br>
      I plan on adding a terminal based forensic tool like PhotoRec, and Sleuth Kit's Scalpel. This allows
      verification on the same device on which sanitization takes place.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Future Prospects</b><br>
      To be 100% certain of data sanitization, a disk read at physical level is required. It should either be done
      using a costly chip reader like PC-3000, or a custom FPGA board connected to the chip using a TSOP DIP48
      adapter.<br>
