        Coursera-dl is a python script which downloads course content from coursera efficiently.<br>
        The general method for downloading content from coursera is by downloading videos individually, which is a very

        So, I searched for a solution. I found a very old github repository with a python script which downloads course
        content from coursera using its API, but not working due to the updated Coursera API.<br>
