  <h1>Keyloggers: A Threat to Privacy</h1>
  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>
  I worked on Keyloggers and Touchloggers for a university project.<br>
  For the project, I was asked to selected a IEEE research paper on any topic as a base paper and then five more supporting paper on the same topic, which should expand the topic. They should also answer the questions from the base paper.<br>
  I searched for papers on Cybersecurity, but finding a paper on which I can find five more papers was a challenge.<br>
  Then I found this paper <!--<a href="Keyloggers_base.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a>--> on keyloggers which was very interesting.<br>
  And there were also papers which expanded and answered the questions from the base paper.<br>
  The following are the supporting papers (yet to be acquired):
<!--   <ol>
  <li><a href="Keyloggers_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="Keyloggers_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="Keyloggers_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="Keyloggers_4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper 4</a></li>
  <li><a href="Keyloggers_5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper 5</a></li>
  </ol> -->
  Then I wrote a <a href="Keyloggers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review paper</a> of my own on all these papers
