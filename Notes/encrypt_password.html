        <h1> Encrypting Passwords with CodeChef </h1>
        <h2> A much better alternative to storing passwords in plaintext </h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        The best passwords are long and random, and they can't be memorized. The best way I know to practice good
        password hygene is by using a password manager. I use <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> as my
        password manager.<br>
        I also store some sensitive information in text files, and compress them into an encrypted zip file using <a
            href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>.<br>
        <h3>The Issue</h3>
        The thing is, there will be few passwords you'll need to remember or store outside password managers. For
        example, Bitwarden needs a master password, and it should be a long and strong password.<br>
        The same applies to the password of the encrypted zip file.<br>
        So, now this brings us back to square one. How do you safely store this password? There are a few possible
        options:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Writing it down on a paper. This is a good way, but the least accessible.</li>
            <li>Saving it in plaintext on a text file. This is the worst way possible.</li>
            <li>You can set a simple and memorizable password as a master password. One with your name or date of birth
                in it. ðŸ‘€ This is worse than storing passwords in plaintext.</li>
        </ol>
        So, what's the solution? <br>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        I think I found a way! To be breif, you can encrypt a single password or a group of passwords using <a
            href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a>, then store the hash and the process of decrypting it in a way
        that only you can understand.<br>
        To be more clear, you can use any one of the many available encryption algorithms from CodeChef. I will give you
        an example so you can understand it better.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Operations column, select <b>Encryption / Encoding</b>. Then select <b>AES Encrpt</b>, and drag
                it to the Recipe column.</li>
            <li>Put whatever you want to encrypt (Single password or a group of passwords) in the Input column.</li>
            <li>There will be different fields like Key, IV, Input, and Output modes for AES Encrypt. I don't know about
                these in detail, but you can follow the below.</li>
            <li>In the Key field, you can see <b>HEX</b>, click on it. Select <b>UTF8</b> from the dropdown for both Key
                and IV.</li>
            <li>Now, the strength of encryption depends on the length of your key and IV, AES-128 uses a 16-byte key,
                AES-192 uses 24-bytes and AES-256 uses 32-bytes.</li>
            <li>So, you have to use something of minimum 16 characters as a key and IV.</li>
            <img src="/Misc/notes/encrypt_password/encrypt.png" alt="Encryption" width="60%">
            <li>Once you set a key and an IV, you will get an encrypted has as output.</li>
            <li>Now, store this and the process in a text file in such a way that only you can understand.</li>
            <img src="/Misc/notes/encrypt_password/text_file.png" alt="Text File" width="30%">
            <li>Decrypting this hash whenever you need is quite simple. Just select <b>AES Decrypt</b> and put the hash
                in input, and give the key and IV. The password will be given as ouput.</li>
            <img src="/Misc/notes/encrypt_password/decrypt.png" alt="Decryption" width="60%">
        </ul>
        <p>As additional measures, you can remove the .txt extension, to avoid your file from being detected when simple
            scripts are run to scrape files with extensions like doc, txt, pdf...</p>
