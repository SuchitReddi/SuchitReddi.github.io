        <h1> GPS Spoofing </h1>
        <p> 
            I'm not going to go into the details of why you might need to spoof your GPS location. I will just explain how to do it on any Android.<br>
            To do the same on an iPhone, check this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/fake-gps-location-4165524" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">blog</a><br><br>

            Install an app called "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.newapphorizons.fakegps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Fake GPS</a>" from the Play Store.<br>
            The next thing you need to do is turn on Developer options. It is a fairly simple process that is identical in most phones.<br>
            (You have to click a few times on build number inside Info or About phone in Settings)<br>
            Once you have turned on Developer options, scroll down to find "Select mock location app", and select the app you installed.<br>
            Some of the apps other than "Fake GPS" are "Windscribe", "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmartstudio.fakegps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Fake GPS location</a>", "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fly.gps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Fly GPS</a>", and another app with same name "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Fake GPS</a>".<br><br>

            After setting up a mock location app, set the location through coordinates of dragging the pin, whatever the app allows. Then click start button and check your maps app to check if it's working.<br>
            Note that a mock location app changes the location for all other apps requesting location. And also there are methods to detect the usage of mock location apps.<br>
