TEMPORARY
We can see MAC address by using ifconfig
MAC address looks like, ether 00:00:27:59:1b:54 
IP address looks like, inet 10.20.54.335
To change MAC, first we have to disable that interface

ifconfig wlan0 down to disable wireless adapter interface.
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 will change MAC.
ifconfig wlan0 up will enable interface again.

We used hw because we want to change hardware address.
An important thing to notice is that MAC address will revert to original after restarting device.

PERMANENT
To change the MAC address permanently, install macchanger

sudo apt install macchanger
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo macchanger wlan0 --mac=4C:21:8C:B8:5D:F2
sudo ip link set wlan0 up

sudo macchanger -s (shows the mac address)
