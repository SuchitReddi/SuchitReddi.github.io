**FOR RASPBERRY PI OS** (Previously Raspbian)

1) Install Pi Imager tool, Putty and VNC Viewer
Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager tool for flashing the OS images. You will need Putty and VNC Viewer to access Pi.

1) Flashing OS
Flash os onto the sd card using raspberry pi imager tool. Enable ssh from advanced options (Press ctrl+shift+x in the imager).


**FOR KALI LINUX**

I wanted to install kali linux on raspberry pi to work on the NAND memory forensics project.
I did not have access to a monitor, so I searched for alternatives, and found that ssh and vnc can be used.
In the beginning, I just installed the raspberry pi imager tool and just flashed the kali os from 
"other specific purpose OS". But, I found out that in versions after April 2023, headless installation
became a hassle. The default credentials "pi" and "raspberry" were removed and no default user was created.
And SSH was disabled after the Mirai outbreak in IoT devices.

The connections I made were ethernet between the pi board and laptop, and power supply to the pi. 
Putty installation is also required. The first hurdle I faced was after flashing the image. 
I went to network and sharing center in control panel. Clicked on the Wi-Fi connection. Then went to sharing inside
properties. I had to enable both the check boxes there. Then select your ethernet connection from the dropdown.
This will provide the ip address of 192.168.137.1 to the ethernet connection by default. Or else you can change the
ip manually by setting static ip and 255.255.255.0 as netmask for the ethernet connection visible as unidentified network.

Once this is done, you need the pi board's ip address. So, we will use apps like Advanced IP scanner/Angry IP scanner. 
This can be easily done using nmap also. Once you open one of the above apps, just scan from 192.168.137.0 to 192.168.137.255. 
One will be your laptop, and one should be a raspberry device. That is the ip of 
the pi board. Try using ping <ip> to check if it is reachable. I received a response.

So, all was well until here, so I gave the same IP address inside putty. If everything is correct, you will be asked 
to accept the certificate. After doing this, it will ask you the username and password. Figuring this out took a long 
time as I got confused with the ones set in the imager tool using advanced options (Ctrl+Shift+X). 
I found out it was incorrect the hard way.

What finally worked was the default credentials kali and kali for any kali image.

Now this is only one part, I only got the ssh access to the pi board. Now I need visuals, hence I need VNC.
Connecting to VNC came with it's own set of problems. What worked for me is:

In PuTTY, go to Connections/SSH/X11. Here enable port forwarding and give the value `:0.0` for display location.
MIT-Magic-Cookie-1 as authentication protocol. Now download Xming.exe for windows and give the path for authority file.
Run Xming application before starting this process. 
`/usr/lib/vino/vino-server` (This started the server, without this an error pops up saying connection is being actively refused)
Then I used RealVNC Viewer and gave the PI's IP address. Then you will get an error about security of the connection.
`gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false` (This command will solve the above error)
Now give the IP address. The VNC window started, but it gave a black screen.
This was solved by going to the terminal and opening raspi-config
`sudo kalipi-config` or `sudo raspi-config`
Select advanced, and go to resolution. There select `DMT Mode 85 1280x720 60Hz 16:9`
Now there is a VNC screen showing the virtual connection, but something is still wrong and you can't type anything
in the terminal. The background image goes black after a few seconds. This issue is yet to be fixed.

It will be better if I can eliminate the need for ethernet cable and directly connect to the pi from some Wi-Fi.
