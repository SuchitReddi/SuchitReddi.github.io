go to index of /kali/pool/main/l/linux from https://http.kali.org
download the linux-headers deb file of your device and type uname -r to see the version of your kali
the download file looks like:-
linux-headers-5.16.0-kali7-amd64_5.16.18-1kali1_amd64.deb  

chmod +x linux-headers-5.16.0-kali7-amd64_5.16.18-1kali1_amd64.deb 
or go to the downloaded files properties and allow it to function as executable

sudo apt install build-essential libelf-dev

dpkg -i linux-headers-5.16.0-kali7-amd64_5.16.18-1kali1_amd64.deb
This step might give errors like some dependencies like linux-kbuild-5.16 is missing etc, you have to download them first from above website and then make them executable and use dpkg.
