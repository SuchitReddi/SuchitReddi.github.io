THIS IS FOR KALI LINUX. Download hashcat utilities from github
HCCPAX IS OUTDATED, USE HC22000

git clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils.git
cd hashcat-utils/src/
make
gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c
mv cap2hccapx /bin
rm cap2hccapx.c
cap2hccapx /root/wpa_handshake-01.cap /root/wpa_handshake-01.hccapx

Output should be:- Written 8 WPA Handshakes to: /root/wpa.hccapx
Now to crack using hashcat

Use "hashcat -h" for help with hashcat
hashcat -m 2500 -a 3 /root/wpa_handshake-01.hccapx ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
This will start a hashcat crack for wpa2 using bruteforce with 8 digit numbers for password


THIS IS FOR WINDOWS. Download hashcat from hashcat.net
GPU Driver requirements:
AMD GPUs on Linux require "RadeonOpenCompute (ROCm)" Software Platform (3.1 or later)
AMD GPUs on Windows require "AMD Radeon Adrenalin 2020 Edition" (20.2.2 or later)
Intel CPUs require "OpenCL Runtime for Intel Core and Intel Xeon Processors" (16.1.1 or later)
NVIDIA GPUs require "NVIDIA Driver" (440.64 or later) and "CUDA Toolkit" (9.0 or later)
Extract 7z zip of hashcat and open cmd from that directory by typing cmd in address bar and then enter

hashcat -m 22000 hash.hc22000 -a 3 ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
This takes the hash from converted cap to hc22000 file and bruteforces it with 8 digit numbers
?l = abcd......xyz
?u = ABCD.......XYZ
?d = 0123456789
?s = all special characters like !@#$%
?a = ?l?u?d?s

MAKING CHECKPOINTS TO RESUME THE BRUTEFORCE LATER:
hashcat -m22000 -a3 -w3 -S --session <name> hash.hc22000 <parameters like ?a?a?a?a>
This will make a session. Using c-checkpoint or q-quit during the bruteforce is saving the checkpoint.

hashcat --session <name> --restore
This will resume the attack from checkpoint (THIS WORKED EVEN AFTER RESTARTING)

You can find the <name>.restore file in the location of your hashcat folder.
Last run session automatically saves as hashcat.restore if you didn't assign any name for the session while starting the attack.
