During recent kali installation of kali 22.2 and kali kernel of 5.16.0-kali7-amd64, I experienced problems at installing grub bootloader stage with the exact message "grub install dummy failed"
I solved this error by going to uefi settings, enabling safe boot and clearing safe boot keys.After that, grub installed successfully.
But, I observed no ethernet and wifi if installed without connecting to ethernet, but after connecting to ethernet, there was no wifi.
I installed only gnome and I got both wifi and ethernet.

After installing kali 23.1, I was not able to run sudo apt update, I got this error message:

W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

To resolve this issue, I thought of editing the /etc/apt/sources.list file's repositories, but editing `deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib` to `deb https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib` solved the issue.
