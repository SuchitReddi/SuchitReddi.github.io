    <p>We can see MAC address by using ifconfig<br />
MAC address looks like,ether 00:00:27:59:1b:54\
IP address looks like inet 10.20.54.335<br />
To change MAC, first we have to disable that interface</p>
    <p>ifconfig wlan0 down to disable wireless adapter interface.<br />
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 will change MAC.<br />
ifconfig wlan0 up will enable interface again.</p>
    <p>We used hw because we want to change hardware address.<br />
An important thing to notice is that MAC address will revert to original after restarting device.</p>
