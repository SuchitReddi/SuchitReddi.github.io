To make a folder in github visible in the website, there must be an index.html file inside it.

If you want to open a link in the website open in the new tab, do this - <p><a href="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">display text</a></p>.

Add the folders you don't want to commit via github desktop to .gitignore.
